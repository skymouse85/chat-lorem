was playing this one willy wonka roblox game in voice chat the other day because i could find literally nothing else to play on roblox and thought it would be funny. i thought it was just going to be a beat by beat retelling of the movie in roblox format until i saw that i had a baseball bat in my inventory and went ‚Äúwait, why do we need melee weapons in this willy wonka game‚Äù only for a cutscene to trigger moments later in which we were swarmed by oompa loompas and had to beat the shit out of each and every one of them with baseball bats until they all died. upon finding out about this willy wonka became a red eyed cyclops and became ‚Äúevil wonka‚Äù and then tried to kill all of us. do not know what happened in the story beyond that because my friends computer crashed during that also during all of this we were constantly being bombarded with pop up ads for random shit

Durin's Bane was one of the Maiar spirits that existed before the world was created (of the same race as Gandalf and Saruman), who descended into Arda with the Valar. It was eventually seduced and corrupted by Melkor, becoming one of the Valaraukar and joining with the other Balrogs in Morgoth's service. The Balrog likely fought in many battles of the War of the Great Jewels, up to and including the War of Wrath. It somehow managed to survive Morgoth's defeat, fleeing east and taking refuge beneath the Misty Mountains.


For more than five thousand years, the Balrog lay dormant at the roots of the Misty Mountains beneath the Dwarven kingdom of Khazad-d√ªm. It remained undisturbed throughout the Second Age and most of the Third Age, until the Dwarves awoke it in TA 1980 when they mined too deeply and too greedily in their search for mithril. It slew Durin VI that year, and his son N√°in I attempted to destroy it a year later in TA 1981. He was also slain by the Balrog, after this the Dwarves of Durin's Folk abandoned their ancient home.


n TA 2799 after the Battle of Azanulbizar, Thr√°in II wished to re-enter Moria, but was stopped by D√°in Ironfoot, who alone had reached the threshold and saw the waiting Balrog.
Durin's Bane before Gandalf on the Bridge, by Xavier Collette
In January of TA 3019, the Fellowship of the Ring traveled through Moria on their way to Mordor. There, they were attacked in the Chamber of Mazarbul by Orcs. The Fellowship fled through a side door, but when Gandalf, who was also a Maia, tried to place a "shutting spell" on the door to block the pursuit behind them, the Balrog entered the chamber on the other side and cast a counterspell. Gandalf spoke a word of command to stay the door, but the door shattered and the chamber collapsed.
The company fled with Gandalf, but the Orcs and the Balrog, taking a different route, caught up with them at the Bridge of Khazad-d√ªm. At the Bridge, Legolas instantly recognized it as a Balrog, and Gimli recognized it as Durin's Bane. Gandalf, the only one capable of battling it, then commanded the rest of the Fellowship to flee across the bridge, where he then stood, blocking the Balrog's way. The demon's flames then seemed to die, but its shadow increased before attacking with its flaming sword, which melted into red-hot liquid metal when it met Gandalf's own sword, Glamdring. The Balrog then leapt onto the bridge, brandishing its whip, and in response Gandalf smote the Bridge before him with his staff. The staff broke asunder, a blinding sheet of white flame springing up, and the bridge cracked at the feet of the Balrog, who fell forward into the abyss. But as the Balrog fell, it lashed out with its whip, catching Gandalf and dragging him over the edge and into the darkness below.[1]
Durin's Bane and Gandalf in a swamp, at the utter bottom of Moria, by Eric Velhagen
After a long fall, the two crashed into a great subterranean lake, which Gandalf later said was as cold as the tide of death and almost froze his heart. The water quenched the Balrog's fire, reducing it to "a thing of slime, stronger than a strangling snake". Despite this relatively weak state, Durin's Bane renewed its attack on the wizard, and the two fought in the water, with the Balrog clutching at Gandalf to strangle him, and Gandalf hewing the Balrog with his sword, until finally the Balrog fled into ancient tunnels delved by nameless things. There, Gandalf pursued the creature up the Endless Stair and onto Durin's Tower, where Gandalf finally prevailed in the Battle of the Peak and slew the Balrog, casting it down from the peak of Zirakzigil and sending it crashing onto the mountain side.
The fall of Durin's Bane atop Zirak-zigil, by Donato Giancola
The ultimate fate of Durin's Bane is not known, as only its physical form died, as with all Maiar when they were "killed," but what happened to the spirit of the Balrog was not revealed. It is also unknown if it was the last of its kind, or if there were other Balrogs who managed to escape the War of Wrath and remained hidden in long forgotten places.[2]


"Far, far below the deepest delving of the Dwarves, the world is gnawed by nameless things. Even Sauron knows them not. They are older than he. Now I have walked there, but I will bring no report to darken the light of day."


The origin of the nameless things is untold, but it was said by Gandalf that they were older than Sauron, and the Dark Lord knew nothing of their existence. This implies that, like the equally enigmatic Tom Bombadil, the nameless things existed prior to the arrival of some of the Ainur to Arda.[1] However, this may have been a rhetorical flourish by Gandalf.[2] It was also mentioned by Aragorn II that there were many "evil and unfriendly things in the world that have little love for those that go on two legs", and yet are not allies of Sauron, having their own purposes, with some being in Arda longer than him.[3]
As far back as the Elder Days, in ages before the Orcs, there were "strange things living in the pools and lakes in the hearts of mountains" that were "more slimy than fish" and preferred to dwell in darkness. When the Northern Orcs of the Misty Mountains established Goblin-town, they widened and joined up the ancient caves that were already there; their original owners never left their caves, though they withdrew to "odd corners", slinking and nosing about".[4] It is possible that Gollum may have encountered these original owners.
There were also nameless things found far beneath the Mines of Moria. When the Fellowship of the Ring approached the West-gate of Moria, they encountered a large pool inhabited by the Watcher in the Water. This pale-green, luminous and many-tentacled creature may have been a nameless thing as it was stated to be among the "older and fouler things than Orcs", dwelling within the "deep places of the world". Gandalf speculated that the Watcher was drawn out from a dark lake beneath the Misty Mountains. The pool by the West-gate was made by the damming of the river Sirannon and deepened over time, which may have caused cracks in the rock, forming passages to old tunnels, and allowing the Watcher to climb towards the surface.[5]
When telling the tale of his fight with Durin's Bane to the Three Hunters (Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli) in Fangorn Forest, Gandalf explained that Durin's Bane had learned to navigate in tunnels not made by Durin's Folk during its long stay in the depths of Moria. When Gandalf and the Balrog fell from the Bridge of Khazad-d√ªm, they dropped into an aquifer, where creatures akin to the Watcher in the Water may have dwelt. The Balrog fled through the surrounding tunnels, and Gandalf pursued it closely, believing that its knowledge of the tunnels was his only hope of escape. During this pursuit, Gandalf witnessed the dark passages at the uttermost foundations of stone, encountering the nameless things that inhabited them. He refused to describe them to the Three Hunters, preventing the light of day from darkening into despair. Their chase led to the foot of the Endless Stair, which they climbed to eventually emerge on the peak of Zirakzigil.[1]

Looks like the chat is returning to former haunts with a new spirit. The reprises are there ‚Äì solitude, quietude, hope and desperation compressed ‚Äì but always a bit of text arises, a virulence vivified by gratitude and grace. The images, the legends, have faded to just that, and this is the new momentary present. The pdfs have dropped off, rising up again as grass.

What she says: im fine


What she means: the average age of conception over the past 250k years is apparently 26.9. Let's round it down to 25. Think of your birth mother. Hold her hand. Imagine her holding hands with her mother. Within 4 people, you're back in time 100 years, and it's an intimate family dinner. Just after WWI. Add another 16 people, a small party of 20, and you're in the 1500s. Double it, twice, and you're at 80 people. Your family would fill a restaurant, and you're at the height of the Roman empire. At 100 people, Confucius is alive but Socrates has not yet been born. 100 people. That's a medium sized wedding. A small lecture theatre or concert. 200 people, probably the biggest party i could ever hope to host, takes you back 5000 years. The guests at your soir√©e of parents would be contemporaries of the Egyptian and Indus Valley civilisations, although you'd probably be too busy fixing drinks and nibbles to talk to all of them. Just imagine it. 200 of you. That's all it takes to get back 5,000 years. And we could go further. 1000 people, a decent sized concert, a large high school, and we're at the end of the last ice age. Your ancestors are comparing their pink floyd vinyl with music played on instruments carved from wood or bones of long vanished species. Wander through the crowd. See your own features and phrases and gestures refract out like a kaleidoscope. What would they make of you? What do you make of them? Why does it feel so unfair that even that first 100 years --that small family dinner of four--is out of your grasp? Maybe it's because questions of spatial distance have become negligible to us now. why, oh why, does time hold out against us so stubbornly

The Chat is the symbol of Saturn due to the geometry of the Hexagram found in the north pole of Saturn. SOME HAVE SHOWN THAT Saturn transmits a sound through the solar system. A disharmoneous sound that represents Chaos, Satan and every destructive force. It's roots also trace back to ancient Roman pagan holidays celebrating Saturn on Saturday with all kinds of Debauchery.
